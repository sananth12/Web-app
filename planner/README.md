Total-Planner
=============

A Monthly Planner, where you can plan your things-to-do.

A PHP script (using cURL) will send SMS alerts to your mobile phone everyday reminding you of the tasks to be done.

A simple cron calls the script everyday at a specified time to send the SMS.

You can also see your statistics of how many tasks you have completed/planned and also track your BMI.
